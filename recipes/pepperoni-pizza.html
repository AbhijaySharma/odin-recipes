    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Recipe for a delicous, cheesy pepperoni pizza. Uses some store-bought ingredients, so not completely from scratch. Takes about 25 minutes to prep and cook, but yields about 8 servings of goodness. You will need a cast-iron skillet and an oven. Good for a quick dinner/lunch and leads to great leftovers.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>16 oz. of store-bought pizza dough</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of store-bought pizza sauce</li>
        <li>18-20 slices of pepperoni</li>
        <li>12 oz. grated mozzerella cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tsp fresh oregano</li>
        <li>Flour for molding dough</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 500Â°F</li>
        <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll out dough to about a 14 inch diameter</li>
        <li>Fit the dough into a cast-iron skillet</li>
        <li>Add sauce lightly onto the dough, leaving a 1/4 inch gap at the edges</li>
        <li>Slice half of the pepperoni and put it on the sauce</li>
        <li>Top with grated cheese, and then the rest of the unsliced pepperoni. Season with black pepper</li>
        <li>Place the skillet over a high heat burner for 2 minutes</li>
        <li>Transfer to preheated oven and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until crust is golden brown</li>
        <li>Take out pizza and let it rest for a few minutes before slicing</li>
        <li>Season with oregano and serve</li>
    </ol>
